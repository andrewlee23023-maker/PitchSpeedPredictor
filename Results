As you can see from the Pitch Speed Predictor Model Weights image, the main factors that influence pitch speed prediction were rate of force development in the rear and front legs, respectively, followed by the torso axial rotation at maximum external rotation, shoulder horizontal abduction at foot plant, and glove shoulder abduction at foot plant. This mostly makes sense, as many current pitch velocity training methods involve increasing force output and based on prior knowledge creating more rotationa power
